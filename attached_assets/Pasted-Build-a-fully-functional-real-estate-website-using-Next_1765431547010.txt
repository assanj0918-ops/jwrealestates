Build a fully functional real estate website using Next.js and Supabase with the following detailed UI/UX and structural specifications:

UI/UX Design:
- Use a single font: Inter.
- Color palette: white, light gray, elegant blue, subtle accent gold for most elements.
- Design theme should look 3-dimensional with subtle shadows, layering, and depth effects on cards, buttons, and sections.
- Generous whitespace for clean, uncluttered layouts.
- Smooth hover effects on buttons, links, and cards with subtle elevation/shadow changes.
- Slide animations for image carousels.
- Soft fade and slide transitions between pages and for modals.
- Loading animations for images and page sections.
- Sticky top navigation bar that is initially transparent when the page is at the top.
- After scrolling down, the navbar changes to a solid color with a smooth transition:
  - Use a deep matte black (#111111) background with slight transparency (e.g. 0.95 opacity).
  - Navbar text and icons change to white (#FFFFFF) when solid.
- Mobile-first responsive design with collapsible hamburger menu.
- Breadcrumb navigation on listings and property detail pages.
- High contrast and accessible color combinations for text and interactive elements.

Hero Section:
- Use a **video background** in the hero section instead of a static image.
